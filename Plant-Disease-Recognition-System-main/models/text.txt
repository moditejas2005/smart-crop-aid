 Complete Flask API Integration
Files Created:
api_server.py - Complete Flask API that serves your Keras model
requirements.txt - Python dependencies
setup_api.bat/sh - Setup scripts for Windows/Linux
test_api.py - API testing script
Updated utils/modelInference.ts - React Native integration
API Features:
✅ Loads your existing model (pest_detection_model_pwp.keras)
✅ Handles base64 images from React Native
✅ Returns structured predictions with confidence scores
✅ CORS enabled for mobile app requests
✅ Health check endpoint for connection testing
✅ All 38 disease classes supported
API Endpoints:
GET /api/health - Check if model is loaded
POST /api/predict - Make disease predictions
GET /api/classes - Get all available disease classes
GET /api/disease-info/<id> - Get detailed disease information
🚀 How to Use:
1. Start the API Server:
cd Plant-Disease-Recognition-System-main
python api_server.py
2. Test the API:
python test_api.py
3. Update React Native (if needed):
In utils/modelInference.ts, change the API URL for device testing:

const API_BASE_URL = 'http://192.168.1.100:5000'; // Your computer's IP
🎯 Integration Flow:
React Native app captures image
Converts to base64 and sends to Flask API
Flask API processes with your trained Keras model
Returns prediction with confidence and crop information
App displays results with treatment recommendations
Your Keras model is now fully integrated and ready to use! The system will automatically use your trained model when the API server is running, falling back to Vision API or simulation if not available.
